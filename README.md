GCodeInfo
=========

 This is a small command line tool to analyse gcodes (control codes for 3D printers, CNC,...). It calculates various print details like -print time -used filament -yx move distance -print object dimension -average print speeds -number of layers -layer details -speed distribution -weight and price of the printed object ...  I used it to optimize my slicer settings and print times for my reprap printer. Tested mostly with slic3r generated gcodes.
